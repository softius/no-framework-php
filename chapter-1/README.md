# Introduction

At the end of this chapter, you will have:
* Created the project directory
* Installed Composer and initialised a new project
* Installed your first dependency

## Project directory structure
Creating the project directory structure is a trivial yet important task. The directory structure lays the foundation on how the code is organized within your application. There are no golden rules here and it all comes down to personal taste and what the project is about. If you are already working on a legacy application, it is strongly suggested to use the existing structure. This could save you from the additional trouble to adjust the existing configuration. In the next section, we will study how the Composer can be configured to autoload classes, according to your directory structure.

The following structure is more than sufficient, in most of the cases. This is common among the modern PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, but please note that the actual directory name may vary from framework to framework. 

* **Application**: your core application code like the application controllers and database models.
* **Executables**: the executable files (command line).
* **Resources**: your application configuration, templates and translation files.
* **Public assets**: the web root directory. It contains your public entry-points along with any other public assets. Usually, there is only one file like app.php or index.php which bootstraps the whole application.
* **Tests**: the automatic tests for your application.
* **Other**: all the files being generated by the application, like cache files and log files among others.

Here is the structure that we will use in the following examples
* `app/` Application
* `bin/`
* `resources/` Resources
* `public/` Public assets
* `tests/` Tests
* `var/` Other
