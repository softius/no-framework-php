# Build your own PHP Application using libraries only

This is a guide on how you can build a modern PHP application without using any framework. In this repository, you will find examples on how you can initiate an application using composer, how you can setup a dependency injector and how you can glue various libraries to produce a working application.

## Why?

You may want to have a look at this repository, in case:

* You are working on a legacy PHP application and you are looking for ways to modernize it.
* You are already using a PHP framework but you want to understand how the magic happens.
* You are looking for a comprehensive tutorial on PHP.
* You have some free time and you want to learn something new.

## Overview

The guide is structured as a series of mini chapters, which can be found in the sub directories of this repository. Each chapter covers a different topic, contains a working PHP application along with a technical guide on how everything was put together.

You can either start from the first chapter and proceed to the last one (chapter by chapter) or jump straight to any chapter.

As part of this guide we will build an application similar to trakt.tv. Here are the features that we will cover

* Search TV Shows
* Integration with tvdb API
* Personalised TV Recommendations
* Personal lists (watched, like to watch)
* API
